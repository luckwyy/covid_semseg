# covid_semseg
This is the code for our paper on the segmentation and classification of covid-19 images.

Our segmentation model code is based on DeepLabV3Plus, you can easily find it here [DeepLabV3Plus](https://github.com/VainF/DeepLabV3Plus-Pytorch).  

Our classification model code is based on torchvision [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/index.html), We changed the last layer of the model slightly to make it fit our needs.
